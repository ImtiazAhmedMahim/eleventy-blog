Before we write our very first post, let’s take care of one last thing. As you recall, we added an “Image” field to the Schema to be able to add a hero image to our posts. But where is Mattrbld supposed to look for that image?

In Mattrbld, all media files, such as images, videos, but also PDFs, and Archives such as ZIP or RAR files live in a single folder (and its sub-folders) referred to as the **Media Library**.

The Media Library is a special kind of Collection that groups all the media files in one central place and allows you to manage and pick them from there through Image fields. All you need to do to configure it for this example is click the file input labelled “Upload directory” in the **Media Library** tab and click the “content” followed by “uploads”, again confirming your selection with the “Pick this folder” in the end. Now all files uploaded through the Media Library will be saved there and clicking on an Image field will allow us to select an image from that folder.

The other options such as the output directory, permissions, and the advanced media library are out of scope for this guide, so let’s ignore them for the time being.

**Quick recap**: we created our Schema and Collection and made it accessible by adding an entry for it in the sidebar. To be able to upload and pick images through Image fields such as the hero image for our posts, we then configured an upload directory in the Media Library settings.

## **Writing Your First Post**

Phew, it’s been a lot of hard work, but Mattrbld is finally set up for some content editing! Click on the “Blog” sidebar entry we created earlier and you’ll be taken to the overview page for the “Blog Posts” Collection.

Here you can add sub-folders to organise your content, as well as create new blog posts via the familiar “Add” button. Click it to create your first blog post! Give the file a name—it doesn’t really matter what, but it probably makes sense to call it something relevant to the post, how about “Hello World”?

Architectures based on modular components have become more and more popular in recent years. Having a single, central space that defines the structure and functionality of a component keeps you from repeating yourself and allows you to change things in only one place and have that change propagate through your entire project.

Custom fields allow you to do just that in Mattrbld as well. As their name implies, they are fields that were customised by you and become their own kind of field. So instead of setting the same options on a default field every time you use it in a different Schema, you can just configure it once, turn it into a custom field and reuse it as many times as you like, just like you can any other field.

On top of that, if you ever need to change those options, you can do so and all the “instances” of that custom fields in your Schemas will be able to be updated to reflect those changes—or not, the choice is yours.

Another common practice is to assemble more complex components from a set of simpler ones, as seen in the concept of Atomic Design. With custom fields, you can extend that practice into Mattrbld as well. Simply use a [**Field Group**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/fields/group/) or [**Container**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/fields/container/) field at the top level and fill it with the fields you need to create a more complex field to be used, for example, in a [**Rows**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/fields/rows/) or [**Columns**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/fields/columns/) field.

With this strategy, it becomes possible to create anything from landing page builders to resources for games directly in Mattrbld without having to dread the moment a new toggle needs to be added to every Text-Block field you might have defined.

## **Creating Custom Fields**

There are two ways to create custom fields in Mattrbld: either from within the [**Schema Editor**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/schema-creation/), or by adding it in the **Custom Fields** tab of the project settings. Like any other configuration file in Mattrbld, custom fields are also simply JSON files stored in your `[**.mattrbld**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/dot-mattrbld/)` [**directory**](https://mattrbld.com/docs/dot-mattrbld/), so theoretically could also write them by hand in a text editor.

### **From the Schema Editor**

If at any time you think you will need to reuse a field you just set up in the Schema Editor somewhere else, you can right-click it and select “Save as Custom Field” from the context menu, which will open a modal window to allow you to do so.
